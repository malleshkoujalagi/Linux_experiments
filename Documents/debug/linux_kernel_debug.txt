1. Kernel Configuration and build.
	a. make meunconfig
	b. General setup, uncheck [] Optimize for size.
		-> General setup
		 -> Compiler optimization level (<choice> [=y])
	c. Change -O2 to -O0 in kernel Makefile such as 
		:%s/-O2/-O0/gc and save it.
	d. If we find any linker errors change to -O1 rather than -O0. a	and try.

	e. If we want to debug particular driver then we go to that driver folder such as driver/net/Makefile
	obj-$(CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET) += virtio_net.o
	then add 
	CFLAGS_virtio_net.o = -O0

	f. Go to kernel hacking section, and enable GDB and debug information, frame pointer help to enable backtrace, check below options:
	 -> Kernel hacking
		->Kernel debugging  
		-> Compile-time checks and compiler options
	        -> Compile the kernel with debug info (DEBUG_INFO [=y])
		-> Compile-time checks and compiler options 	
		->KGDB: kernel debugger 

	g. make -j 12

2. Use gdb folder scripts and create guest image, enjoy live debugging kernel.
